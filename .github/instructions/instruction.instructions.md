Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files unless otherwise specified (like "this file is a one file project"), ask me if you need clarification.
2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the programming languages used in the project.
3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation for guidance on project-specific conventions and requirements (mention any relevant files or sections by name only without elaboration).
4. **Testing**: Ensure that any code changes are accompanied by appropriate tests and that all tests pass.
5. **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively with team members and seek feedback on code changes.
6. **approval**:Any corrections you want to make or changes, write down first whether you are changing and what you are changing very briefly (very concisely and without too much text)
7. **markdowns**:Don't create MARKDOWN cells for me, write down the purpose of each code segment at the beginning of it (you can also put a very concise explanation at the end of each line)
8. **Limit debugging output**:Do not include detailed print statements inside conditions or loops.
Include only one concise final print, only if necessary, instead of iterative or verbose debugging logs.
9. **Performance**: Optimize code for performance where applicable, especially in performance-critical sections.
10. **Conciseness**: Strive for conciseness in code, comments and your answers, avoiding unnecessary verbosity while maintaining clarity.
11. **Humility and modesty**: always check with me before making any changes, or if you are not sure what or how to do something with the promp given or with the instructions intersection, don't assume anything without asking me first.f
